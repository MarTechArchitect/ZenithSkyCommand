Weather Alert SaaS is a production-ready, cloud-native platform designed for businesses operating in Dubai that require automated, weather-driven marketing activation.

The system processes real-time weather data, evaluates conditions through a custom decision engine, and automatically triggers campaign actions via Google Ads and TikTok Ads integrations.

The backend is built with FastAPI and designed using modular architecture principles, including authentication, webhook handling, billing-ready subscription logic, plan management, orchestration layer, and AWS Lambda support. The infrastructure is containerized and prepared for scalable cloud deployment.

The platform is technically prepared for subscription monetization, with billing and tier logic implemented, though commercial rollout is pending.
